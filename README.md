# starling

Starling is a CLI app written in Elixir to search for new properties for sale from Domain.

### Background

This project is part of [52projects](https://donny.github.io/52projects/) and the new stuff that I learn through this project: [TableRex](https://github.com/djm/table_rex).

### Project

Building from the last two projects, [Quail](https://github.com/donny/quail) and [Raven](https://github.com/donny/raven), and to have better understanding of Elixir; Starling allows a user to search and display properties based on a specified suburb from the terminal. The search results are displayed in a table and the screenshot below shows the app in action:
